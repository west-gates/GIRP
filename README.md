## Global Model Interpretation via Recursive Partitionin (GIRP)
This paper implements the menthod described in paper [Global Model Interpretation via Recursive Partitionin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04253). The implementation is based on the project [Python-Regression-Tree-Forest](https://github.com/chandarb/Python-Regression-Tree-Forest). Please cite both works properly if you are using them in your work.

### Prepare data
You should prepare the input data as the example `dm_txt.csv` and `df_txt.csv` in this repo. 

`dm_txt.csv` contains the classification labels. Column `pid_visit` is the ID of each prediction instance. Column `lbl_visit` is the label of each prediction instance.

`df_txt.csv` contains the local contributions of input variables for each prediction instance. Column `ctb_contrb` is the local contributions. Column `pid_contrb` is the ID of each prediction instance. Column `var` is the names of input variables. The example contributions are generated by a random forest classifier from the [20 Newsgroups Dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/).

### Run the example
```
git clone git@github.com:west-gates/GIRP.git
cd GIRP
virtualenv venv --python=python2.7
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```
The steps above will generate an interpretation tree `selected_tree.jpg`.
