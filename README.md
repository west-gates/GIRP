## Global Model Interpretation via Recursive Partitionin (GIRP)
This paper implements the menthod described in paper [Global Model Interpretation via Recursive Partitionin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04253). The implementation is based on the code in this [repo](https://github.com/chandarb/Python-Regression-Tree-Forest). Please cite both works properly if you are using them in your work.
